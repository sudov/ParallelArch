============

Some parallel program stuff for school 

-> PA1: Seq vs Parallel speedup of 2.33x without compiler optimizations
	
	Timing: 
	Sequential: 544617 microseconds
	Parallel:   233167 microseconds

-> PA2: Seq vs Parallel N-Queens speedup of 5x over 8 processors for queens in the range 8-15
	
	Timing: 
	Sequential: 6.45s (1proc, 15 queens)
	Parallel: 6.83s (1proc, 15 queens)
